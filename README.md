# Blue-vs-Red-Team-Final-Project-Presentation

  # Unit Description
  
In this project, I acted as a security engineer supporting an organization's SOC infrastructure. The SOC analysts noticed some discrepancies with alerting in the Kibana system and the manager asked the security engineering team to investigate and confirm that newly created alerts were working.

  # Days 1 and 2: Alert and Attacking Target 1

  Configure alerts in Kibana

  Capture the flag on the victim machine.

  # Day 3: Final Group Presentations

  Submit a defensive blue team analysis
